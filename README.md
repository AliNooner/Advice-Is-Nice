## Introduction

Just a Thought is an app that provides life advice and postive thoughts to users looking for a little inspiration. This project was assigned as a final solo project of Module 3 at [Turing School](turing.edu) and was completed within 5 days. This project was a showcase of lessons throughout the module - including React fundamentals, React Router, and Cypress testing.

When visiting the application, a user views a calming and easy-to-navigate page. They are able to click on a button to receive a random thought or piece of advice. Users are able to add a piece of advice to their Favorites page and then navigate to a different page to view their saved favorites all in one space. They are then able to come back to the home page to continue searching for advice.
